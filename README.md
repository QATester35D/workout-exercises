This is a Python repository to build a database repository of workout exercises.
The source of the exercises will come from:
- API call to a free open source repository to retrieve exercises and add/insert into the database
- A json file I will/have created to read from for additional exercises of my own to add/insert into the database
- MySQL Database interaction - inserts to add exercises to DB
  - select statements to retrieve exercises
- Create a Word document that will consist of a workout plan based on the selections
