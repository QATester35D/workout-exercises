This is a Python repository to build a database repository of workout exercises.
The source of the exercises will come from:
- API call to a free open source repository
- A text file I will have created to read from for additional exercises of my own to add to the database
- Database interaction - inserts to add exercises to DB, selects to retrieve exercises
- Create a Word document that will consist of a workout plan based on the selections
